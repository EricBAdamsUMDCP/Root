Did you turn on Xming 11?

Signal saturation
>ADC= 127 is saturation becaause it is 8 bit. (ADC tells us about our saturation)
>* ADC=127 is maximum possible signal measurement but signal in reality may be higher!!!
>We use multiple time slots to deal with saturation as the thing gets saturated we switch to the next time slot and get the bleed off (its like a ccd).
>Always Initialize variables otherwise it may not work!
e.g.
 Double_t         centrality[1];

  Double_t 		   HADsum=0;
  Double_t		   PEMsum=0;
  Double_t		   RPDsum=0;
  Double_t         ETsum = 0;
  Double_t		   NEMsum = 0;
  Double_t		   NHADsum = 0;
  Double_t		   PHADsum = 0;
 
 >Time slices that have no data in them are used for NOISE Subtraction e.g. 0-2

>The commands used to set fc values to greater than zero are used after noise compensation/subtraction so no negative values
are made by accident

Histograms
>0.00115 means its in TeV scale
>   MAKE SURE I DEFINE AXES CORRCTLY OR IT WONT LOOK GOOD, DOUBLE CHECK
